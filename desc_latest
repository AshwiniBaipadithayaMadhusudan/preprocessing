At Approximately 14:30 P.S.T. The W SBDSBD1-19T was shoving 105 cars Eastbound on the Leon Pass (8271) at 4mph when the crew noticed that the second car from the east end BN 467737 (east truck B-end) had derailed. Initial investigation shows that this derailment was caused due to track ties (M.O.W had just placed between main track two and the Leon Pass track 8271) that were to close and got stuck between the truck and the ground. This caused the BN 467737 to derail. No track damage and initial cost right now are at $200.00 for roller bearing damage. This is not impacting mainline traffic and this car will be re-railed first thing Monday Morning.

This is an initial report of a non-reportable human factor derailment that occurred at 1700 hours November 22, 2009 when YBAK2062-22 failed to stop short of switch point derail improperly lined and derailed axles one and two.   Foreman on YBAK2062-22 was in the process of retrieving the BNSF 2915 from the RIP track. Foreman linked up to the BNSF 2915 moved unit toward derail, stopping 100 feet from the derail. Foreman then unlocked derail and pulled the unit eastward through the derail. Foreman was on the ground protecting the movement, and ahead of the locomotive. Once the movement started the Foreman realized he failed to line the derail and stopped the movement.  Helper was in the switchmans shanty charging his radio when the incident occurred.  Crew was interviewed in the Bakersfield terminal and Foreman was drug and alcohol tested. Upon interviewing the crew, Foreman admitted to focusing on too many moves at one time instead of focusing on the task at hand.
