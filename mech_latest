Industry did a poor job of clearing snow, ice, and frozen mud in between the rails.  The engine was not heavy enough to bust through all the build up. Since they are in an industry, they are responsible for the rerail. They were given all info to assist them in that. The caboose fouling the main was picked up by another crew on a unit train parked on the other main. I stayed on site to assist if needed. No problems picking up the caboose and tying back onto their train.

At approximately 2130 the U BWWCOT0 12 was attempting to yard their train in Conroe yard Track 7122.  Due to a soft subgrade, lead engine BNSF 5013 fell inside the track and rolled the outer rail causing the next locomotive and 3 additional cars to derail before the movement was stopped.  Train was actually half  way in the yard at POD.  There were no injuries to the crew, and all cars and locomotives are upright.  Downloads were secured my RFE Monte Matthews around midnight, with no exceptions to train handling.  Plan as of right now is to have Vulcan unload in the morning, and after completion we will pull the remaining cars in 7122 over to track 7121, with rear portion sitting in 7125..  This will allow Hulcher to re-rail moving Westward opposed to setting up in the culverts and fields on the outer side. If Vulcan is unable to get this train unloaded before night fall, we will utilize the BNT0031 on Monday morning.  Due to holiday annulments this will have little to no impact on yard operations on Monday morning.  Estimated Cost: Hulcher: Pending (2 side booms needed) Mechanical: $2,000 (Roller Bearing Inspection on cars and J Blocks on both units, will have to be done on site in Conroe) Engineering: $2,800 (Ties and rail)

This is the initial report of a non-injury, non-hazmat, non-RCO operation derailment that occurred at the switch between engine running and the freight house crossover in Hobson Yard at approximately 0800 on April 10, 2015. Assignment Y-LIN510P-10A and Y-LIN811J-10 was in the process of moving lite engine BNSF 4995 to the roundhouse.  While proceeding east on engine running over the facing point switch properly lined for movement into the freight house crossover, the lead set of trucks on BNSF 4995 derailed.  Pilot notified the Control Yardmaster over the radio, who then notified the Tower Trainmaster and Terminal Manager.  MOW and Locomotive departments were notified and arrived on scene to assess the damage.  Written statements were taken and crew was instructed to return to service.  No drug and alcohol test or investigation were scheduled.  Locomotive BNSF 4995 was re-railed at 1055.  Track was taken out of service due to broken rail.  Will impact movement of power to the roundhouse.  Estimated time back in service is 1500.   Estimated damages involved with this incident involves: Engineering Costs: TBD Mechanical Costs: TBD  Cause of this derailment is TBD.

Officers are currently on scene and have determined that there are 06 cars derailed (30 wells), all upright non-consecutively throughout the train. Walking inspection is on-going to determine car numbers as well as damage. Mechanical cost $150k  this estimate might go up slightly, we are finding some gouged wheels (not derailed) after it stopped raining.  POD is about 2.5 miles away from derailment. Wheel dropped 6 ft from switch point, initial track notes with no exceptions. Follow wheel marks for 2 miles with indication of wheel plate coming off seat. Half a mile where train stops notice left side of wheel finally coming down. We will send wheel to TR&D. No exceptions on detector data. Two Hulcher Divisions on site, waiting for Transportation to clear head 21 cars to start working. We will need to block both main lines to re-rail 100% of the derailment. Cause is still under investigation.

Train was making East shove when it went into emergency. Upon inspection by crew they discovered 7 cars on the ground: BNSF 781759, ATSF 622936, BNSF 615753, ATSF 178673, GATX 70513, UTLX 644198, and SIOX 31086. Initial discovery of 2 1/2 ft of rail broken at point of derailment was cause. Estimated damages approximately $50,000 due to the changing of all wheels on all 7 cars and the changing out of  brake beams. The cars traveled over 200 feet. Hulcher on scene at approximately 1245. We began re-railing cars at 1400 with the last car re-railed at approximately 2130.

Everett Mechanical and Interbay Wwrecking Crew all responded. Hulcher was initially called out but turned around and not used. 4 cars derailed all upright on a 10 degree curve due to rolled rail lines 58-61 of a 65 car train. BNSF 434907 loaded covered hopper with barley, BNSF 428759 loaded covered hopper with barley, SRY 9245 loaded box with paper, and NOKL 550077 empty box. Car damage estimated at $21,000 attributed to mostly wheel changes. Limited access to this location and very tight quarters. Cars were all rerailed by BNSF Mechanical forces with rerailing frogs one car at a time working with the local section to relay the rail to each car so that they could be pulled back on. Track department reports the track is "ugly" but legal. Downloads were pulled by the Road Foreman of Engines and we are waiting for a report out after he reviews with the Superintendent of Operating Practices. Playbook measurements will be taken on all the cars as well as the track and train handling reviewed and then we will get back together with all departments for an official closeout. Cars are in B3 status and will be measured and repaired on the Everett Repair Track once spotted.

Hulcher rerailed.  Unless further info is gathered that proves otherwise, based upon the side bearing clearances (side bearing clearances are all in spec. none of them were under 1/8 of an inch) and the detector standpoint (this locomotive has not exhibited any elevated or alarming THD, TPD or WILD readings within the last twelve months), I see no merit for this categorized as a mechanical cause.  Locomotive damages are $1,500.

Rerailed with frogs at 0905, $3000.00 dollars damage to LBR 1006.  PER SCOTT VANGOSEN: Based on the photo it appears that this load was not secured properly according to the AAR Open Top Loading Rules.  This load should be secured per Figure 47 (attached) from Section 2 of the Open Top Loading Rules Manual.  Basically each individual piece should have blocking against all four sides bolted to the car floor to prevent the lading from shifting.  This car was interchanged from the NS to BNSF at ESTL.  I sent the basic information of the loading exception to the NS so they can follow up with the shipper and their employees as necessary, I have also asked the NS to provide the shipper contact information so I can follow up with the shipper directly.  In addition I asked the NS to verify whether or not there are any more loads from this shipper moving to BNSF and if there is to stop and inspect for proper securement.

09:45 MST back on the rail. $3500.00 Damage to the BNSF 8831.  The service track supv and the crew handling light power to house did not dialog about what route they were taking to the power to the east end.  Rectifying this gap in communication is going to be a key to eliminating this type of failure in the future.  0345 The M DILLAU1 24 called for track, crew was instructed to back their power in on the west end of the OKC and knuckle into the 6241.  The crew asked if we would have someone help guide them in as it had been some time since they had been on that track.   0357 The E VILSXM0 02 called for track and was instructed to bring their power to the Dakota track.   Sometime between 0400 and 0415 the M train backed in on the OKC with help from our hostlers.  After the power was in on the OKC the switch was lined back to the run around.   Having sent the machinists to work on the M train power supv tried to put a block on the OKC track, at this point supv noticed the RH6 switch flashing back and forth.  Supv checked the camera to see if the empty power was in the area of our RH switches.  Supv called the hostlers quickly to see if everyone was in the clear as supv could see the empty power coming down the round around toward RH6.  Supv tried again to line the switch toward the run around and had no luck as the switch was still flashing.  0429 RH6 switch shows red both into mech facility and down the run around, indicating that the switch was split.  0434 E VILSXM0 02 crew calls and tells supv they are on the ground.

At approx 2305 MST, the X TACABA9 13H o/d at 1945, was taking power from the roundhouse to their train. 4 units: BNSF 4822 (east most unit), BNSF 7293, CSXT 681, BNSF 5212. The crew was told by the roundhouse to depart out the West end as the east end was blocked. The first switch was lined for their movement, the second switch was not. The conductor lined the second switch and continued the movement. The conductor was on the ground protecting the shove to the next three switches. Switch 3 and 4 were lined for their movement and they needed to get a locomotive and a half through switch 5. The conductor states she checked the switch and it looked to be lined for their movement. When the head end of the consist cleared switch #4 the conductor re-joined the engineer on the head end (BNSF 4822) and they proceeded east. The engineer started in 1 throttle and found it was difficult to pull so he went to two throttle then three throttle. When the consist continued to pull hard, the engineer decided to stop the movement. Upon inspection by the conductor, it was found the rear two units (CSXT 681 and BNSF 5212) were derailed. Primary cause is run thru switch on west end of Glendive RH by conductor.
